The green elm with the one great bough of gold  
Lets leaves into the grass slip, one by one, --  
The short hill grass, the mushrooms small milk-white,  
Harebell and scabious and tormentil,  
That blackberry and gorse, in dew and sun,  
Bow down to; and the wind travels too light  
To shake the fallen birch leaves from the fern;  
The gossamers wander at their own will.  
At heavier steps than birds' the squirrels scold.  
The rich scene has grown fresh again and new  
As Spring and to the touch is not more cool  
Than it is warm to the gaze; and now I might  
As happy be as earth is beautiful,  
Were I some other or with earth could turn  
In alternation of violet and rose,  
Harebell and snowdrop, at their season due,  
And gorse that has no time not to be gay.  
But if this be not happiness, -- who knows?  
Some day I shall think this a happy day,  
And this mood by the name of melancholy  
Shall no more blackened and obscured be.
