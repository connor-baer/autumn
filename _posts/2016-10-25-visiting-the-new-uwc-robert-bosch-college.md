[UWC Robert Bosch College](http://www.uwcrobertboschcollege.de/en/) is one of two new colleges set to open in 2014 and will be the first UWC in Germany. Based in Freiburg in the South-west of the country, the college is located in an important university and ‘green’ city. In October I attended an [AFS](http://www.afs.org/) seminar that happened to take place in Freiburg. Obviously I wanted to visit the site.

From Freiburg’s city center I walked along the road down the Dreisam valley. Google Maps said it would take about 15 minutes but I ended up walking for 45 minutes — the constant rain didn’t make it any better. (Side note for future RBC students: don’t walk to the city center unless you have to. There’s a tram station nearby, it’s much faster.) Finally the valley widened and there it was: The magnificent former Carthusian monastery with the eight cubic residences right next to it.

I apologize for the bad quality of the photos, I took them with my iPod camera and it obviously sucks. As you can see the residences are still under construction and the charterhouse is in the process of being completely renovated. Fun fact: when digging behind the charterhouse they found bones in the ground. [Here](http://www.uwcrobertboschcollege.de/en/fotogallery) are photos. Maybe it’s haunted by a former monk…

I walked around a bit to get a better impression of the campus. It’s beautiful! The view across the valley, the old buildings, the soccer field right in front, the garden…so many possibilities for the future students!

> “UWC Robert Bosch College will place a particular emphasis on environmental issues. A key question will be how technology can contribute to sustainable, ecological development and peace.”

Another fun fact: Linked to the property is a license to distill liquor. I doubt that they will allow the students to make use of it though…

Two days ago I had the chance to talk to Laurence Nodder, former head of Waterford Kamhlaba UWC and future principal at RBC. He’s a truly remarkable man with a great vision. It’s kinda sad that he left Swaziland just before I’m about the go there. On the other hand — he’s the perfect person to lead the new college.

The other new UWC opening next year is [UWC Dilijan](http://uwcdilijan.org/) in Armenia. A new UWC in China planned to open in 2015 received preliminary approval from the International Office in October. Exciting times lie ahead!
